# Princess_Of_Ice_and-Snow
One of the games I created using Unreal Engine for a virtual worlds class. 

 Learned the basics of using Unreal Engine to create a video game. 
 
 Story/Plot:
 
 Her name is Aurora. Cast out from her castle above the clouds, she fell upon a village under the protection of 3 cursed skulls. 
 They send her to find her power, locked deep inside of her soul. Will she emerge victorious? Or will she be trapped beneath the ice?
